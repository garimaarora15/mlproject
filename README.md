## End to End Machine Learning Project - Student Performance Prediction
This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict student performance based on various features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course etc. It involves the entire machine learning lifecycle, including:<br>

<b>Data Ingestion:</b> Collecting and preprocessing raw student data from multiple sources.<br>
<b>Data Transformation:</b> Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the data for use in model training, with feature engineering techniques applied.<br>
<b>Model Training:</b> Implementing machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or more advanced models to predict student performance.<br>
<b>Pipeline Deployment:</b> Automating data ingestion, transformation, model training, and evaluation processes for a seamless and scalable workflow.<br>
<b>Evaluation:</b> Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error.<br><br>

This project aims to create a robust, automated pipeline that can predict student outcomes.
